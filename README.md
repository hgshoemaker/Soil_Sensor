This is a platformio-based ESP32 program for the 7-in-1 Soil Sensor (5 Probe), 
I'm using the H2Zero/NimBLE-Arduino library to connect to my iPhone over BLE with BLESerial nRF from the App Store. 
I'm taking a reading every 10 seconds and averaging the results, then sending them to the iPhone. 
My main reason for this program was to research the relationship of earth conductivity to very low frequency stimulus 
to see if there is a difference related to conductivity versus the magnetic coupling based on the VLF frequency. Also, make grass grow under my pecan trees :).
